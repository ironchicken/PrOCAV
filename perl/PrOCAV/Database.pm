# FIXME Think about all the properties a field will need. For example,
# when a new work is added to the spreadsheet, its uniform_title will
# need to be available to any spreadsheet cell which provides a
# uniform_title lookup. The implication is that fields need "accessor
# methods" which should be functions to be executed by the
# spreadsheet. A solution could be that the look-up cells use the
# uniform_titles column of the "works" worksheet, plus a pre-defined
# list of uniform_titles taken from the database.
