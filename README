Prokofiev Catalogue Raisonn√©
----------------------------

This project has been funded by the Prokofiev Foundation and is
managed by Berta Joncus in the Music Department at Goldsmiths. Its aim
is to produce an online catalogue of the works of Serge Prokofiev.

Its ISMS relevance is that Tim Crawford is a consultant and Richard
Lewis is developing the database and the software.
