        The Digital Archive will be created as Phase 3 of the
        PCDA. Selected manuscripts (music, letters, ephemera) will be
        linked to catalogue entries, and accessed directly via the
        Browse menu. Metadata will explain the contents and the
        relation of digitized materials to the work. An index will
        list all digitized materials. To view digitized sources
        outside those published on PCDA you will be asked to apply to the
        <a href="http://www.sprkfv.net/archive/contact.html">Foundation</a>.
